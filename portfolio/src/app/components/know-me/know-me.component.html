                                My interest in development lives in every layer of the .NET stack. From Web
                                Forms to WPF to MVC, my desire is to create unique and intuitive applications
                                for
                                small business, enterprises and individuals. I am self taught and remain current
                                with industry standards in modern tools, platforms, frameworks and methods.
                                I develop using ASP.NET with C#, Entity Framework, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                                and jQuery and dabble with PHP.

                                My passion lies in back end development and reaches into the front end where I
                                enjoy creating custom eye catching user interfaces.

                                In 2016, over 50% of the use of the web was from mobile devices.
                                I believe non-responsive applications are the mark of a lazy developer.
                                <br><br>
                                I bootstrap or create custom responsive frameworks for my work.
                                While in the enterprise world, I understand that are justifications for
                                non-responsive sites in large enterprise
                                applications, however, I see this need as a dying flame.

                                While my prodcuts looks pretty and function well, I never treat application
                                security as an afterthought. I always place a very
                                large emphasis on keeping data safe.
                                <br><br>
                                I use security
                                frameworks that are mature and have been tested over time.
                                I most enjoy using the .NET Identity Framework as it is versatile, supports
                                Single Sign On and is extensible and customizable.

                                open source code,
